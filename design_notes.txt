A constituency view should probably have two PolicicianModels - one for current 
MPs and one for candidates in upcoming election. 

Constituency objects will probably have to have 
current mp data and this will need to be considered for the 
DisplayROle of the constituency.

I need to think about what loadCache methods - in particular, 
do these call QAbstractItenModel::resetModel() or do their callers 
do this? I feel like their callers should do this. It should be public functions that 
call model QAbstractItenModel::resetModel() and QAbstractItenModel::dataChanged() methods 
etc. 

Do I need two politician tables? One for elected and one for candidates? Or do I just need 
two bool columns called elected and candidate. Probably the latter - that's what I've gone with.
